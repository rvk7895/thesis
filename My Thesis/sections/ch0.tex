The advent of online dating platforms, spearheaded by technological advancements and changing societal norms, has significantly transformed the landscape of romantic and interpersonal relationships. Among these platforms, Bumble has emerged as a frontrunner in India, promoting itself as a site of progressive values with its unique feature allowing only women to initiate conversations \cite{noauthor_bumble_nodate}. This shift towards digital intimacy is underpinned by a growing internet user base in India, projected to reach 1.3 billion in 2023 \cite{noauthor_india_nodate},  creating an expansive arena for online dating applications.

However, the promise of these platforms is mired in complexities concerning algorithmic biases. Despite their potential for facilitating diverse and inclusive interactions, the algorithms driving these platforms often replicate and amplify societal biases. Such biases are not inherent to the algorithms but stem from the data on which they are trained, reflecting historical and cultural prejudices \cite{davidson-etal-2019-racial, Raghavan_Barocas_Kleinberg_Levy_2019}. In the case of Bumble, the platform's algorithm learns from user behaviour to make match recommendations, a process that, while seemingly neutral, can inadvertently perpetuate discrimination based on gender and other social identities. Kordzadeh \& Ghasemaghaei highlight the scant empirical examination of algorithmic bias despite extensive conceptual discussion of its ethical, legal, and design implications. Their work underscores a critical gap in understanding how biases embedded within algorithms affect user perceptions and behaviours, particularly in systems driven by data and designed to make recommendations, such as online dating platforms.

The consequences of these biases extend beyond the digital space, affecting users' self-perception and interaction with others. For individuals of non-binary genders, these biases can result in reduced visibility and misrepresentation, reinforcing existing gender norms and excluding them from fully participating in the online dating experience \cite{Bivens_Hoque_2018, MacLeod_McArthur_2019}. The "Elo Score" system, speculated to be used by Bumble, illustrates this issue by ranking desirability based on opaque factors, potentially marginalizing users who do not conform to mainstream criteria of attractiveness \cite{Carr_2016}

Furthermore, the role of dating apps in shaping social norms and behaviors is increasingly acknowledged, with platforms like Bumble influencing not just romantic interactions but broader societal perceptions of gender and sexuality \cite{Das_2019, Forbes_2020}. The integration of features aimed at inclusivity, such as pronoun selection and guides for queer dating, highlights Bumble's efforts towards creating a safer and more welcoming environment for all users. However, the persistence of algorithmic biases underscores the challenges of reconciling technological innovation with the need for social justice and equality.

The study of gender disparities in Bumble's match recommendations thus sits at the intersection of technology, culture, and social justice. It offers a critical lens through which to examine the implications of algorithmic decision-making on social identities, highlighting the urgent need for more inclusive and equitable design practices in the realm of online dating.

\section{Statement of the Problem}
The proliferation of digital platforms has transformed many aspects of human social interaction, notably the sphere of romantic and interpersonal relationships. Among these platforms, dating applications like Bumble have gained prominence for facilitating connections between users. However, these applications are not devoid of implications for social equity and inclusivity. Recent research has underscored the potential for algorithmic bias in such platforms, which can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases, particularly those related to gender \cite{Hutson_Taft_Barocas_Levy_2018, Lambrecht_Tucker_2019, Selbst_Boyd_Friedler_Venkatasubramanian_Vertesi_2019}

This study explicitly investigates gender disparities in the algorithmic recommendations provided by Bumble, a leading dating platform. Bumble’s algorithms, which are designed to learn from user behavior and preferences, may inadvertently reproduce existing societal biases, affecting the visibility and representation of users across the gender spectrum. The gravity of this issue is magnified in the Indian context, where rapid digitalization and shifting cultural norms around gender and relationships create a complex socio-technical landscape \cite{Das_2019, Forbes_2020}.

Despite Bumble's efforts to create an inclusive platform — such as offering extensive gender identity options and promoting women's agency in initiating conversations — concerns remain regarding how the underlying algorithmic processes may favor certain user groups over others \cite{Bivens_Hoque_2018, MacLeod_McArthur_2019}. The preliminary findings from our research suggest a notable discrepancy in the match recommendations for users identifying with different genders, with non-binary users potentially facing distinct challenges \cite{Kalra_Gupta_Varghese_Rangaswamy_2023}.

This problem is situated within a broader discourse on algorithmic fairness, which demands critical scrutiny of the socio-technical systems that increasingly mediate human interactions. The implications of biased algorithmic recommendations extend beyond individual user experiences, reflecting and reinforcing wider social inequities. Thus, this study seeks to articulate and analyze the specific manifestations of gender bias within Bumble's recommendation algorithms and explore their implications for users’ experiences and identities, particularly in the Indian socio-cultural context.

Addressing this problem necessitates a multi-dimensional investigation that considers not only the technical workings of algorithms but also their interaction with human behaviors, societal norms, and the regulatory frameworks that govern digital platforms. By exploring the nuances of gender bias in Bumble’s algorithmic recommendations, this research contributes to the broader discourse on digital ethics, social justice in technology design, and the pursuit of inclusivity in digital spaces.

\section{Scopes and Limiations}
The exploration of gender disparities in Bumble’s match recommendations undertaken in this study is bounded by a focused examination of user experiences across different gender identities within metropolitan areas of India. The choice to center the research on urban settings was informed by the higher prevalence and diverse user engagement with dating apps in these areas, providing a fertile ground for investigating the nuances of algorithmic bias and user interactions. However, the study’s concentration on a small participant pool, while enabling a detailed qualitative analysis of individual narratives, introduces several limitations that must be acknowledged.

Firstly, the findings of this study, owing to its limited geographic focus and sample size, may not encapsulate the breadth of experiences of all Bumble users in India, especially those residing in rural or less urbanized locales. The diversity of socio-cultural norms, access to technology, and attitudes towards gender and dating outside metropolitan areas remains unaddressed, potentially limiting the generalizability of the research outcomes.

Moreover, despite including participants from a range of gender identities, the limited number of participants means the study might not fully represent the extensive spectrum of user experiences related to gender diversity on Bumble. The complexity and individuality of gender identity and expression suggest that a broader, more heterogeneous sample could unveil additional insights into the platform’s inclusiveness.

A significant challenge faced by this research is the proprietary nature of Bumble’s algorithms. The lack of direct access to the algorithmic frameworks and data sets underpinning match recommendations means that any analysis of algorithmic biases is necessarily based on indirect evidence, such as user perceptions and observed outcomes. This limitation underscores the broader issue of algorithmic transparency within digital platforms.

Lastly, the study's findings reflect a particular moment in time, framed by the current state of Bumble’s algorithms, user behaviors, and societal attitudes towards gender and dating. The dynamic nature of digital platforms means that these elements are subject to change, which could affect the relevance of the study’s conclusions in the future.

Despite these constraints, the research provides crucial insights into the presence and implications of gender biases in algorithmic match recommendations on Bumble, highlighting the need for ongoing investigation into algorithmic fairness and inclusivity. It contributes to a deeper understanding of the intersection between technology and social dynamics, laying the groundwork for future research and discussions on creating equitable digital spaces.
