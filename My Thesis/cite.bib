    abstract = "Technologies for abusive language detection are being developed and applied with little consideration of their potential biases. We examine racial bias in five different sets of Twitter data annotated for hate speech and abusive language. We train classifiers on these datasets and compare the predictions of these classifiers on tweets written in African-American English with those written in Standard American English. The results show evidence of systematic racial bias in all datasets, as classifiers trained on them tend to predict that tweets written in African-American English are abusive at substantially higher rates. If these abusive language detection systems are used in the field they will therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on African-American social media users. Consequently, these systems may discriminate against the groups who are often the targets of the abuse we are trying to detect.",

The introduction of the Internet can have vastly different implications on traditional societies and practices such as arranged marriages in India. This chapter seeks to investigate using an ethnographic approach the role of matrimonial Web sites in the process of arranging marriages in India. It seeks to explore how these Web sites have been appropriated by key stakeholders in arranging marriage and how such appropriation is changing the process and traditions associated with arranged marriage. The key contributions of this study are in that it is an investigation of complex social processes in a societal context different from traditional western research contexts and an exploration of how mod-ern technologies confront societal traditions and long standing ways of doing things. Our investigation suggests that the use of matrimonial Web sites have implications for family disintermediation, cultural convergence, continuous information flows, ease of disengagement, virtual dating and reduced stigma in arranged marriages in India.},

	abstract = {Indian matrimonial websites, as a new and popular medium for seeking marriage partners, have millions of users and have become increasingly important in India's marriage market as of the late 1990s. Despite their traditional approach, evident in their structure and design, these online spaces nevertheless reflect new dimensions of media usage and choice of partners. They show the active intervention of people in their own future planning. By assuming a basic connection between the growing media access and profound changes within contemporary Indian society, this article links media-based changes in matchmaking to an overall social change in post-liberalization India. With new lifestyles and social realities, notions regarding marriage, love, and gender roles are gradually being reworked. The analysis of the online matrimonial market and how it has been appropriated, offers remarkable insights into these dimensions of social change. Ninety percent of India's marriages are still termed as arranged, as opposed to the category of love marriage. But the varied ways in which many young Indians engage with matrimonial media show that this dichotomy of terms needs urgent revision. Increasing social, physical, and media mobilities serve in manifold ways as a key factor in social change, particularly with regard to women and marriage. The pervasive gender image of the New Indian Woman is an influential role model in online representations as well as in personal narratives. She rambines a modem lifestyle with cultural rootedness and makes way for new forms of subjectivity and agency. In the context of changing patterns and concepts, the ideological difference between agency and choice with regard to decision-making in matchmaking emerges as another crucial point for discussion. While agency emphasizes the capacity to act, choice is connoted by a consumerist viewpoint. But the explicitly new aspect about a medialised marriage market is the progressively interactive nature of online matrimonial media.},
